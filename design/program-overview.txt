 In this design, Store acts as the central class, containing the store's 
 transactions, its customers and its inventory of movies. 
 Store contains Transaction (composition), and all the possible transaction
 types (History, Inventory, Borrow and Return) inherit from Transaction.
 Store also contains customer information in the form of a Hash Table of
 Integer keys to Customer values, and a movie inventory in the form of a 
 Hash Table of String keys to Binary Tree values.
 The three types of movies (Comedy, Drama, Classics) inherit from the movie
 class.
